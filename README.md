# Hello!

**What is this?** 

This is me keeping skills sharp and attempting to learn a little bit about 
the languages and technologies out there. Sometimes, these little brainteasers 
are a fun way to pass time and see what is possible within a language I want to 
explore. This repo won't contain any large projects, just a collection of tiny ones. 

### Technologies

My aim is to do each of these in four languages, just not always in this order:
C#, Python, Rust, and Javascript. 

C# &mdash; The first language that I used that made me feel like I was interacting 
with a computer. Initially, I thought C# was only available in Visual Studio, but 
I've been wanting to explore the `dotnet` commands to see how much Visual Studio 
provides and also how much of it I may not really need. Additionally, having used 
Java, I can see the amount of work Microsoft has put in to make C# more than just 
a Java clone, but absolute magic sometimes. 

Python &mdash; The dark horse language for me thus far. When I was getting started, 
a lot of people were saying things like "Python's a great starter language, but 
you can't build anything with it" and I took their word for it because I didn't have 
the means to dive any deeper at the time. As I began to look at career opportunities 
and learn about the tools used for certain jobs, a surprising amount of them wanted 
Python, especially in data-focused roles. I've since used it to create websites, 
but I don't feel that it's available libraries really make it all that easy; 
Django is a lot to get through and can be confusing with the number of directories 
you'll need to sort through. Flask is a bit barebones, but is a nice place to 
start if you get overwhelmed easily. On another note, Jupyter Notebooks are 
a fantastic way to incrementally test code and I've used it to make a few quick 
tools for work. 

Rust &mdash; The hype-train language that's taking the backend by storm. 
This language has been called all the good stuff from a C killer to the future 
of all development. Also said to be wicked safe and a joy to work with thanks to 
strict, but not overbearing, compilation rules. Earning quotes like *"If it 
compiles, ship it!"* and *"The language that won't wake you up at 4 AM."* I'd 
love to learn how Rust achieves its safety and build some applications with it. 

JS &mdash; This one is still sort of a dark horse, but in a different way. I always 
understood Javascript to be the language that makes the browser do cool stuff. 
While that remains true, it's gone places it has never gone and maybe shouldn't 
continue to go. Hate it or love it, it appears to be here to stay. Now, you may 
see me use Typescript sometimes, but it's just a method of keeping my brain straight.

### Running the programs
Unless otherwise noted, everything but C# should be cross-platform, though you 
may need to recompile (Rust and C#). 

- For Rust projects, navigate into the project directory and run `cargo run`. 
This will compile for your platform and run the program. 
- For C# projects, you should be able to run `dotnet run` from inside the 
project directory. 
- Python and JS are both scripted languages, so there's nothing to compile. 
    - Python (3.9+) projects can be run with `python3` and the file name.
    - JS/TS projects can be run with `node` and the filename, given you have 
    Node installed.

C# is the only language that requires Windows because of the `dotnet` CLI tool. 
I use a smattering of computers, so the non-C# languages can be written on 
anything from my phone, to my tablet, to a Raspberry Pi to a Steam Deck.

### About writing in four languages
I aim to give a little feedback about the process of writing for each prompt, 
so look for another `*.md` file within each language's directory for a little 
more commentary.
